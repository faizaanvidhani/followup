                            There is no standard quantifiable measure to measure the severity of symptoms in Parkinson's
                            patients for everyday life in a single doctorâ€™s visit -- treatment adjustments are
                            suboptimal. Therefore, there is a strong need to translate the everyday experiences the
                            patient is having in such a way that the doctors can readily understand and adjust
                            treatment needs.
